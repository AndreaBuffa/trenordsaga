Google Endpoints API Management manages the 'control plane' of an API by
providing support for authentication, billing, monitoring and quota control.

It achieves this by

- allowing HTTP servers to control access to their APIs using the Google Service Management and Google Service Control APIs
- providing built-in, standards-compliant support for third-party authentication
- doing this with minimal performance impact via the use of advanced caching and aggregation algorithms
- making this easy to integrate via a set of `WSGI`_ middleware

.. _`WSGI`: https://wsgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/


Example:

  .. code:: python

   >>> application = MyWsgiApp()  # an existing WSGI application
   >>>
   >>> # the name of the controlled service
   >>> service_name = 'my-service-name'
   >>>
   >>> # The Id of a Google Cloud project with the Service Control and Service Management
   >>> # APIs enabled
   >>> project_id = 'my-project-id'
   >>>
   >>> # wrap the app for service control
   >>> from endpoints_management.control import client, wsgi
   >>> control_client = client.Loaders.DEFAULT.load(service_name)
   >>> control_client.start()
   >>> controlled_app = wsgi.add_all(application, project_id, control_client)
   >>>
   >>> # now use the controlled in place of application
   >>> my_server.serve(controlled_app)
